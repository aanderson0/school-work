to run:

make
oclgrind ./conway <-o> <-n #>


notes:

	-unexpected behaviour with more than 26 kernels
	-if used with 1 kernel it just runs in serial, I did this for testing purposes
	-everything is done in global memory because whenever I tried to use local memory
	 I just kept getting illegal reads
