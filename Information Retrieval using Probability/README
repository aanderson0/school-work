NLP Assignment #2

This software is used to create an index file for a set of documents and retrieve
documents based on similarity to given queries.

To run:

    make
    OR
    make all
        *builds program

    make tokenizer input=FileName
        *Takes document file FileName.txt and produces a tokenized version FileName.tokenized
            e.g. make tokenizer input=test
    
    make preprocessor input=FileName
        *Takes tokenized file FileName.tokenized and produces a processed version FileName.processed
            e.g. make preprocessor input=test

    make indexer input=FileName
        *Takes processed file FileName.processed and produces indexing files, dictionary.txt, postings.txt, and docids.txt
            e.g. make indexer input=test

    make retriever
        *Will look for indexing files and ask for queries from the command line
        *Input and output can be redirected with < inputFile and > outputFile
            e.g. make retriever < queries.txt > output.txt

    *NOTE: if input=FileName isn't present it will default to looking for a file called documents
    *NOTE: FileName must not include the extention

    make clean
        *cleans directory

test plan:
    Run each segment with a small dataset (test.txt) and verify by hand the output is correct.
    Run the whole thing with a larger dataset (documents or documents_small) to see it still works with diverse data.

limitations / potential improvements:
    When retriever is receiving input from a file the query isn't displayed and it doesn't parse out $QRY statements
    Inner products aren't normalized
    Won't handle bad data (Incorrectly formatted document files)
